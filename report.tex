\section{Data set}

\begin{enumerate}

    \item What is the domain of the problem about?

    We tackle the problem of determining what video game should be purchased or played

    \item What is the source of the data?

    \item What is the point of view of the decision maker?

    \item What is the number of alternatives considered? Were there more of them in the original data set?

    \item Describe one of the alternatives considered (give its name, evaluations, specify preferences for this alternative)

    \item What is the number of criteria considered? Were there more of them in the original data set?

    \item What is the origin of the various criteria?
    (catalog parameter / created by the decision maker - how?)

    \item What are the domains of the individual criteria (discrete / continuous)? Note: in the case of continuous
    domains, specify the range of the criterion's variability, in the case of others: list the values. What is
    the nature (gain / cost) of the individual criteria?

    \item Are all criteria of equal importance (should they have the same ”weights”)? If not, can the relative
    importance of the criteria under consideration be expressed in terms of weights? In this case, estimate
    the weights of each criterion on a scale of 1 to 10. Are there any criteria among the criteria that are
    completely or almost invalid / irrelevant?

    \item Are there dominated alternatives among the considered data set? If so, present all of them (dominating
    and dominated alternative), giving their names and values on the individual criteria.

    \item What should the theoretically best alternative look like in your opinion? Is it a small advantage on
    many criteria, or rather a strong advantage on few (but key) criteria? Which?

    \item Which of the considered alternatives (provide name and values on individual criteria) seems to be the
    best / definitely better than the others? Is it determined by one reason (e.g. definitely the lowest
    price) or rather the overall value of the criteria? Does this alternative still have any weaknesses?

    \item Which of the considered alternatives (provide name and values on individual criteria) seems to be the
    worst / definitely worse than the others? Is it determined by one reason (e.g. definitely the highest
    price), or rather the overall value of the criteria? Does this alternative still have any strengths?

% ==================

\section{Problem analysis with the use of PROMETHEE I and II}

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Write the preferential information you provided at the input of the method.

    \item Enter the final result obtained with the method. Usually, the first result is not the final one, you can
    slightly adjust the parameter values to your preferences.

    \item Compare the complete and partial ranking.

    \item Comment on the compliance of the results with your expectations and preferences. Refer, among
    others, to to the results for the alternatives that you indicated as the best and worst during the data
    analysis. What operations were required to obtain the final result (e.g. changing the ranking of criteria,
    adding blank cards, changing the value of threshold)?
